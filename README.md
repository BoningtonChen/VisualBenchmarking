# A Boningotn's Visual Benchmarking Project

## Brief Introduction
> - This is a visual benchmarking project for C++ based on Google Chrome static analysis.

## How to use
> - Run the main.cpp file (or you can build your own source file and put the functions above the main function in main.cpp file in your own source files).
> - Then a result.json file will be generated.
> - Drag and drop the result.json file into Google static analysis system.
> - After that you should be seeing the result, which is a chart of your source file's benchmark.
